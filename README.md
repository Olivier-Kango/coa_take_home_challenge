<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# üìñ Interactive Photo Gallery <a id="about-project"></a>

>  This challenge assesses my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as my problem-solving abilities. I will build an interactive photo gallery based on provided [Figma designs](https://www.figma.com/design/XF6xlvvHBv12WFveDjVoso/COA-Take-home-Challenge?node-id=0-1&t=Vf51V3iQYoBTI2G3-0) and complete two JavaScript coding challenges to test my logical thinking and coding aptitude. This challenge is part of my application process at Code of Africa ([CoA](https://www.codeofafrica.com/EN)).

**Interactive Photo Gallery** allows the user to view, navigate, and interact with a collection of photos dynamically. Users can click on thumbnails to see larger versions, navigate through photos using next/previous buttons, and possibly apply filters or sort options to the gallery.

<!-- CHALLANGES -->

## üìù Challenges <a id="challenges"></a>

### Coding Challenge 1: Array Manipulation

**Problem Statement: :** Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous
subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return true if such a subarray exists,
otherwise return false.

**Example:**
**Input:** arr = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 5], target = 17
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The subarray [7, 1, 9] sums up to 17, which is equal to the target.
**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the array.
**Expected Space Complexity:** O(1).


### Coding Challenge 2: String Transformation

Here's the updated problem statement with real-world word examples:

**Problem Statement:** Here's the updated problem statement with real-world word examples:
- If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
- If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
- If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), perform
both operations in the order specified above.

**Example Input:** "Hamburger"
**Output:** "regrubmaH"
**Explanation:** The length of the string is 9, which is divisible by 3 but not by 5 or 15.
Therefore, the string is reversed, resulting in "regrubmaH".

**Example Input:** "Pizza"
**Output:** "80 105 122 122 97"
**Explanation:** The length of the string is 5, which is divisible by 5 but not by 3 or 15.
Therefore, each character is replaced by its ASCII code, resulting in "80 105 122 122 97".

**Example Input:** "Chocolate Chip Cookie"
**Output:** "eikooCpihCetalocohC"
**Explanation:** The length of the string is 21, which is divisible by 3 but not by 5 or 15.
Therefore, the string is reversed, resulting in "eikooCpihCetalocohC".

**Constraints:** 
‚óè The string will only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces.
‚óè The length of the string will be between 1 and 1000.
**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string.
**Expected Space Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string.

**Note:** You can assume that the input will always be valid and within the specified
constraints. Your solution should handle all possible cases and return the transformed
string accordingly.

These examples use real-world words related to food to illustrate the transformations
applied based on the divisibility of the string length by 3, 5, and 15.
